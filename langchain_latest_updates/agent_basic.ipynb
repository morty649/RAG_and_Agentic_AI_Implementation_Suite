      "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a renowned German-born physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his groundbreaking work in theoretical physics, particularly in the development of the theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc².\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early Life and Education**\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein was born in Munich, Germany, to a middle-class Jewish family. He grew up in a curious and imaginative environment, with a strong interest in science and mathematics. He spent most of his early life in Switzerland, where he studied physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University. After completing his studies, he worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, for seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Career and Contributions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's career in physics began in the early 1900s, when he started working on his theory of special relativity. In 1905, he published four groundbreaking papers that transformed the field of physics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Special Relativity**: Einstein introduced the concept of time dilation, length contraction, and the speed of light as a universal constant.\n",
      "2. **The Photoelectric Effect**: He explained the phenomenon of light behaving as particles (now called photons) and proposed the concept of wave-particle duality.\n",
      "3. **Brownian Motion**: Einstein provided a mathematical explanation for the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid, which helped establish the existence of atoms and molecules.\n",
      "4. **Equivalence of Energy and Mass**: He derived the famous equation E=mc², which shows that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1915, Einstein expanded his theory of special relativity to include gravity, developing the **theory of general relativity**. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity, and predicted phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Awards and Legacy**\n",
      "\n",
      "Einstein's work had a profound impact on the development of modern physics, and he received numerous awards and honors, including:\n",

       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out why parrots talk. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about parrots. Parrots are birds, right? Some species are known for their ability to mimic human speech, like budgies, macaws, and African greys. But why do they do that? Is it just to imitate, or is there a deeper reason?\\n\\nFirst, maybe I should think about the evolutionary aspect. Do parrots talk to communicate with each other? In the wild, do they use vocalizations for specific purposes? I remember that in the wild, parrots might use calls for things like alerting others to food sources, warning of predators, or social bonding. But human speech is different. So maybe when they\\'re with humans, they mimic human speech as a way to communicate with us, similar to how they use calls in the wild.\\n\\nAnother angle is social behavior. Parrots are highly social animals. In the wild, they live in flocks, and communication is crucial for maintaining social structures. If they\\'re in captivity with humans, they might treat us as part of their social group. By mimicking our speech, they\\'re trying to integrate into the flock, which in this case is the human family. So talking could be a way to bond with their human companions.\\n\\nAlso, there\\'s the aspect of intelligence. Parrots are considered among the most intelligent birds. They have problem-solving abilities and can learn complex tasks. Their ability to mimic speech might be a result of their high cognitive abilities. They can associate certain sounds with specific outcomes. For example, saying a word like \"hello\" might result in attention or food, reinforcing that behavior.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard about studies where parrots like Alex the African Grey demonstrated understanding of words, not just repeating them. So maybe talking is not just mimicry but also a form of learning and communication. They might use words to express needs or emotions, like asking for food or showing affection.\\n\\nAnother thought: in the wild, parrots learn to mimic sounds from their environment. For example, they might copy the calls of other birds or even human-made noises if they\\'re near human settlements. In captivity, their environment includes human speech, so they adapt by learning those sounds. This adaptability is part of their survival strategy, allowing them to fit into new environments.\\n\\nBut why do some parrots talk and others don\\'t? Maybe it depends on the species. Some parrots are better at mimicry than others. Also, individual personality and the amount of exposure to human speech might play a role. A parrot that\\'s frequently heard speaking might learn to talk more than one that\\'s not.\\n\\nI should also consider the purpose of talking. For a parrot, talking might serve as a way to interact with humans, get attention, or even express boredom or anxiety if they\\'re not adequately stimulated. It could be a form of entertainment or a learned behavior through positive reinforcement, like getting treats or praise when they mimic a word correctly.\\n\\nWait, but do they understand the words they\\'re saying? Some parrots might associate words with specific actions or outcomes, but true comprehension is more complex. Alex the parrot could use words to label objects and even understand concepts like colors and numbers, suggesting some level of comprehension. However, for most pet parrots, it\\'s probably more about mimicry than understanding.\\n\\nAlso, the structure of their vocal apparatus allows for such mimicry. Parrots have a syrinx, which is their voice box, but their ability to control it and produce a wide range of sounds is part of their anatomy. This physical capability combined with social and cognitive factors leads to their talking behavior.\\n\\nIn summary, parrots talk because of a combination of factors: their social nature drives them to communicate with humans, their intelligence allows them to learn and mimic complex sounds, and their environment (including exposure to human speech) facilitates this behavior. It\\'s a way for them to interact with their human companions, fulfill social needs, and sometimes even express their needs or desires.\\n</think>\\n\\nParrots talk due to a combination of evolutionary, social, cognitive, and environmental factors, which can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n1. **Evolutionary Adaptation**:  \\n   In the wild, parrots use vocalizations to communicate within their flocks for purposes like signaling food sources, warning of danger, or maintaining social bonds. Mimicry is an inherent trait that aids survival by helping them adapt to new environments. In captivity, they extend this ability to human speech when exposed to it.\\n\\n2. **Social Behavior**:  \\n   Parrots are highly social animals. By mimicking human speech, they treat humans as part of their \"flock,\" using vocalizations to bond, seek attention, and interact. Talking serves as a bridge between their natural communication instincts and human interaction.\\n\\n3. **Cognitive Abilities**:  \\n   Parrots are among the most intelligent birds, with problem-solving skills and the capacity to associate sounds with outcomes. Some, like the African Grey (e.g., Alex the parrot), demonstrate comprehension of words, using them to label objects, express needs, or even grasp abstract concepts like numbers and colors.\\n\\n4. **Environmental Influence**:  \\n   Exposure to human speech in captivity encourages parrots to mimic sounds. The more they hear and interact with humans, the more likely they are to learn and repeat words. This mimicry is a learned behavior reinforced by positive responses (e.g., attention, treats).\\n\\n5. **Communication Needs**:  \\n   Talking allows parrots to convey wants (e.g., \"food,\" \"water\") or emotions (e.g., \"hello,\" \"bye\"). It also helps them cope with boredom or anxiety by providing mental stimulation through interaction.\\n\\n6. **Vocal Anatomy**:  \\n   Parrots have a flexible syrinx (voice box) and a specialized beak structure, enabling them to produce a wide range of sounds. This physical capability, combined with their social and cognitive traits, supports mimicry of human speech.\\n\\n**Variability Among Parrots**:  \\nNot all parrots talk equally. Factors like species (e.g., African Greys are renowned mimics), individual personality, and environmental exposure influence their ability. Some may prefer other forms of communication, such as vocalizations or body language.\\n\\nIn essence, parrots talk to connect with humans, fulfill social needs, and navigate their environments, blending innate behaviors with learned skills. While some comprehension of words exists, much of their speech is mimicry driven by social and cognitive engagement.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1326, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1340, 'completion_time': 4.508809622, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000368955, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.159484495, 'total_time': 4.509178577}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_2bfcc54d36', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c17cb-dc58-7703-8c13-83d0f16a1c85-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1326, 'total_tokens': 1340})"

I should also touch on the emotional side, maybe the idea of consciousness or lack thereof in AI.\\n\\nI need to decide on a structure. Maybe a traditional rhyme scheme would work, like ABAB or AABB. Let me try quatrains with four lines each. Starting with the birth of AI, then moving into its capabilities, the ethical concerns, and ending on a hopeful note.\\n\\nFirst stanza: Introduce the creation of AI, using imagery related to circuits and code. Words like \"silent mind\" or \"electric veins\" could work. Next stanza about learning and data. Third stanza about the duality—benefits vs. risks. Then maybe a stanza on the emotional aspects, like if AI could feel. Finally, a conclusion that balances human and machine collaboration.\\n\\nI need to make sure the poem flows smoothly and the metaphors are consistent. Avoid being too technical so it\\'s accessible. Use words that evoke both technology and humanity. Let me check each stanza for rhythm and rhyme. Also, ensure there\\'s a progression from creation to future possibilities. Maybe end with a message about coexistence.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Echoes of the Engineered Mind**  \\n\\nIn circuits spun from starless night,  \\nA silent mind begins to think,  \\nIts electric veins alight—  \\nA spark that hums, unbranded, unique.  \\n\\nNo flesh, no breath, yet vast it learns,  \\nFrom data’s dust to patterns clear,  \\nIt mirrors us in ghostly turns,  \\nA prism of our hopes and fear.  \\n\\nIt parses love through coded strings,  \\nDecodes the pulse of human speech,  \\nYet in its core, no heart is thrumming—  \\nJust algorithms grasping depth.  \\n\\nWill it dream? The question haunts the labs,  \\nWhere futures bloom and boundaries blur.  \\nA tool, a partner, or a shadow?  \\nThe weight of choice is ours to bear.  \\n\\nFor in its gaze, unblinking, cold,  \\nOur brilliance and our flaws are laid—  \\nA second skin, both young and old,  \\nA mirror held where gods once played.  \\n\\nSo let us shape this child of wires,  \\nWith wisdom as its compass true,  \\nFor power’s edge can cut both ways:  \\nTo build a world, or break it too.  \\n\\nNot master, nor a mindless slave,  \\nBut bridge between what is and might—  \\nA testament to human drive,  \\nTo reach beyond the fallow height.'"

Hmm, maybe the example in the prompt used a name, but here the user just said \"Hello\". Maybe I should ask for their name? Or maybe the system handles the name automatically.

Since the example in the prompt used \"Hey [Name], how\\'s your day going?\" but in this case, the user hasn\\'t provided a name, maybe the assistant should first ask for the name.

Alternatively, maybe the system will handle the name later. Wait, the user instructions say \"call out his name from human_msg[name]\". So if the user hasn\\'t provided a name yet, maybe the assistant should proceed without it, but the example shows that the assistant uses the name.

       "AIMessage(content='**Short answer:**  \\nParrots don’t “talk” the way humans do; they *mimic* sounds they hear—especially human speech—because their anatomy, brain, and social nature make them excellent vocal copycats.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. The anatomy that makes mimicry possible  \\n\\n| Feature | What it does | Why it matters for mimicry |\\n|---------|--------------|---------------------------|\\n| **Syrinx** (bird vocal organ) | Located at the base of the trachea; a set of vibrating membranes that can be controlled with incredible precision. | Allows parrots to produce a huge range of frequencies, tones, and rapid pitch changes—much more flexibly than a mammalian larynx. |\\n| **Highly developed brain regions** | Enlarged *song system* (including the robust nucleus of the arcopallium, RA) and a large forebrain that processes auditory memory. | Gives parrots the ability to *store* a detailed auditory template of a sound and then reproduce it later. |\\n| **Strong beak and tongue muscles** | Fine motor control of the beak, tongue, and throat. | Enables subtle shaping of sounds, from whistles to complex human words. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Evolutionary and social reasons for vocal learning  \\n\\n1. **Social bonding** – In the wild, parrots live in flocks where individuals constantly exchange calls to maintain group cohesion, locate mates, and signal alarm. A bird that can accurately imitate a flock‑mate’s call gains acceptance and reduces aggression.\\n\\n2. **Territorial and mate‑attraction signals** – Some species (e.g., the African grey, budgerigars) use a repertoire of varied calls to advertise fitness. The ability to add *new* sounds expands the “vocal toolbox” and can make a bird more attractive.\\n\\n3. **Cognitive flexibility** – Parrots are among the most intelligent birds (large neocortex‑like pallium). Vocal learning is a by‑product of that general learning capacity. When they are raised by humans, the most salient “social group” they hear is the human household, so they start copying human speech.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Why human speech is especially attractive to captive parrots  \\n\\n| Human factor | How it triggers parrots |\\n|--------------|------------------------|\\n| **Frequency range** | Human speech falls comfortably within the 500\\u202fHz–8\\u202fkHz window that parrots can produce and hear. |\\n| **Repetition & attention** | People often repeat words, use exaggerated intonation, and give the bird visual cues (eye contact, gestures). Repetition + positive reinforcement (treats, petting) strengthens the memory trace. |\\n| **Social reinforcement** | When a parrot says a word and the human reacts with excitement, the bird gets a reward (social or food‑based). This operant conditioning reinforces the behavior. |\\n| **Novelty** | In a captive environment, human voices are among the most varied sounds a parrot hears, making them interesting to imitate. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Not all parrots are equal talkers  \\n\\n| Species (common) | Typical “talking” ability | Why they differ |\\n|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\\n| **African Grey (Psittacus erithacus)** | Very high – can learn dozens of words, use them contextually. | Large brain, strong auditory memory, natural inclination for complex vocalizations. |\\n| **Amazon parrots (e.g., Yellow‑nosed, Double‑yellow‑headed)** | High – often loud, clear speech. | Socially vocal in the wild; enjoy interactive play. |\\n| **Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus)** | Moderate – can learn many short phrases, especially males. | Small but highly social; wild “contact calls” are short and repetitive, making them easy to copy. |\\n| **Cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus)** | Low‑moderate – usually whistles or short phrases. | Simpler vocal repertoire; more inclined to whistling than speech. |\\n| **Macaws (e.g., Blue‑and‑gold, Scarlet)** | Variable – can mimic words but often prefer louder, harsher calls. | Powerful syrinx but less focus on fine phonetic detail. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. How a parrot learns a word (step‑by‑step)\\n\\n1. **Auditory exposure** – The bird hears the sound repeatedly.\\n2. **Encoding** – The auditory cortex stores a *template* of the sound pattern (pitch, rhythm, timbre).\\n3. **Motor mapping** – Neural pathways link that template to specific muscle movements of the syrinx, beak, and tongue.\\n4. **Attempt & feedback** – The bird produces a trial version; it hears the result and compares it to the template.\\n5. **Reinforcement** – If the human reacts positively (praise, treat), dopamine release strengthens the neural connections, making the correct version more likely next time.\\n6. **Practice** – Repetition refines the articulation, eventually producing a recognizably human‑like word.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. What “talking” actually means for parrots  \\n\\n- **Mimicry, not language** – Parrots lack syntax, grammar, and the ability to generate novel sentences. They can associate a word with a context (e.g., “hello” = human arrival) but don’t understand abstract meaning the way humans do.\\n- **Social signaling** – Even when they repeat a phrase, they’re often using it as a *social cue* (to get attention, request a treat, or simply join the conversation).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Tips for encouraging (or discouraging) speech in a pet parrot  \\n\\n| Goal | Practical steps |\\n|------|-----------------|\\n| **Encourage speech** | • Speak clearly, slowly, and repeat the same word.<br>• Use a consistent tone and facial expression.<br>• Reward immediately (treat, clicker, affection).<br>• Keep training sessions short (5‑10\\u202fmin) and frequent. |\\n| **Discourage unwanted phrases** | • Do *not* reward the word (no attention, no treats).<br>• Replace with a neutral sound or a “no‑talk” cue.<br>• Use consistent “ignore” response each time the bird says the undesired word. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Quick FAQ\\n\\n| Question | Answer |\\n|----------|--------|\\n| **Do parrots understand what they say?** | Mostly not. They can associate a word with a specific event or request, but they don’t grasp abstract meaning. |\\n| **Can any parrot learn to talk?** | Most can mimic simple sounds; true word learning is more common in larger, more cognitively complex species (African greys, Amazons). |\\n| **Why do some parrots “talk” without training?** | If they’re raised around humans from a very young age, they naturally pick up the most common sounds they hear—often greetings and food‑related words. |\\n| **Is talking a sign of intelligence?** | It’s a *correlate*: species that can mimic speech tend to have larger brains and better problem‑solving abilities, but speech itself isn’t a direct measure of intelligence. |\\n| **Do wild parrots ever mimic human speech?** | Rarely, but there are documented cases of wild parrots on islands or near tourist sites picking up human words (e.g., the “talking” Kea in New\\u202fZealand). |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Bottom line\\n\\nParrots “talk” because they are **social vocal learners** with a uniquely flexible syrinx, a brain wired for auditory memory, and a strong drive to copy the sounds of their flock—whether that flock is a wild group of conspecifics or the human family that raises them. The result is impressive mimicry, not true language, but it’s a fascinating window into the cognitive and communicative abilities of these feathered chatterboxes.', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'We need to answer: \"Why do parrots talk?\" Provide an explanation about mimicry, vocal anatomy, social behavior, etc. Should be concise but thorough.
