Introduction\\nIn this paper, we seek to give a concrete representation of martingales. We will present\\ntheorems of the following form. Given a martingale sequence (fn) (possibly vector valued),\\nthere is a martingale (gn) on the probability space [0, 1]N, with respect to the ﬁltration Ln,\\nthe minimal sigma ﬁeld for which the ﬁrst n coordinates of [0, 1]N are measurable, such\\nthat the sequence (fn) has the same law as (gn). Thus any martingale may be represented\\nby a martingale\\ngn((xn)) =\\nn\\nX\\nk=0\\ndk(x1, . . ., xk),\\nwhere\\nR 1\\n0 dn(x1, . . ., xn) dxn = 0 for n ≥1. (Here, as in the rest of this paper, the notation\\n(xn) will refer to the sequence (xn)n∈N, where N refers to the positive integers.)\\nThe value of such a result is perhaps purely psychological.\\nHowever, we will also\\npresent similar such results for tangent sequences, and also for sequences satisfying condi-\\ntion (C.I.). Tangent sequences and condition (C.I.), as deﬁned in this paper, were intro-\\nduced by Kwapie´n and Woyczy´nski [KW]. The abstract deﬁnition of tangent sequences can\\nbe, perhaps, a little hard to grasp. However, in this concrete setting, it is clear what their\\nmeaning is. To demonstrate the psychological advantage that this view gives, we will give\\na new proof of a result of McConnell [M2] that states that tangent sequence inequalities\\nhold for the UMD spaces.\\nWe will also give a weaker version of a result of McConnell [M1] that provides a\\nSkorohod representation theorem for vector valued martingales, in that any martingale is a\\nstopped continuous time stochastic process. This means that many martingale inequalities\\nthat are true for continuous time stochastic processes are automatically also true for general\\nmartingales.\\n2\\n2. Representations of sequences of random variables\\nIn this section, we present the basic result upon which all our other results will depend.\\nFirst let us motivate this result by considering just one random variable, that is a\\nmeasurable function f from the underlying probability space to a separable measurable\\nspace (S, S). (A measurable space is said to be separable if its sigma ﬁeld is generated by\\na countable collection of sets.) We seek to ﬁnd a measurable function g : [0, 1] →S that\\nhas the same law as f, that is, given any measurable set A, we have that Pr(f ∈A) =\\nλ(g ∈A), or equivalently, given any measurable bounded function F : S →R, we have\\nthat E(F(f)) =\\nR\\nF(g) dλ. Here λ refers to the Lebesgue measure on [0, 1].\\nFirst, it may be shown without loss of generality that (S, S) is R with the Borel sets.\\n(The argument for this may be found in Chapter 1 of [DM], and is presented below.) Then\\nthe idea is to let g be the so called increasing rearrangement of f, that is,\\ng(x) = sup{t ∈R : Pr(f < t) < x}.\\nThat g has the required properties is easy to show.\\nNext, suppose that f is nowhere constant, that is, we have that Pr(f = s) = 0 for all\\ns ∈S. Then it may be seen that g is a strictly increasing function. In that case, it may\\nbe seen that the minimal complete sigma ﬁeld for which g is measurable is the collection\\nof Lebesgue measurable sets.\\nNow let us move on to state the main result. We will start by setting our notation.\\nWe will work on two probability spaces: a generic one (Ω, F, Pr), and ([0, 1]N, LN, λ). Here\\nLN refers to the Lebesgue measurable sets on [0, 1]N, and λ refers to Lebesgue measure on\\n[0, 1]N.\\nLet us make some notational abuses. The reason for this is to make some expressions\\nless cumbersome, while hopefully not being too obscure. We will always identify [0, 1]n\\nwith the natural projection of [0, 1]N onto the ﬁrst n coordinates.\\nAny function g on\\n[0, 1]n will be identiﬁed with its canonical lifting on [0, 1]N. The notation Ln refers to the\\nLebesgue measurable sets on [0, 1]n, and also to their canonical lifting onto [0, 1]N. We will\\nlet λ also refer to Lebesgue measure on [0, 1]n.\\nGiven a random variable f, and a sigma ﬁeld G, we will say that f is nowhere constant\\nwith respect to G if Pr(f = g) = 0 for every G measurable function g. Let us illustrate\\nthis notion with respect to a measurable function f on [0, 1]2. It is nowhere constant with\\nrespect to the trivial sigma ﬁeld if and only if it is nowhere constant as deﬁned above. Let\\nG be the sigma ﬁeld generated by the ﬁrst coordinate. Then f is nowhere constant with\\nrespect to G if and only if for almost every x ∈[0, 1] the function y 7→f(x, y) is nowhere\\nconstant. Now let G be the set of all Lebesgue measurable sets on [0, 1]2. In this case, f\\ncan never be nowhere constant with respect to G.\\nIf f1, . . . , fn are random variables taking values in a measurable space (S, S), we will\\nlet σ(f1, . . ., fn) denote the minimal sigma ﬁeld which contains all sets of measure zero,\\nand for which f1, . . ., fn are measurable. Note that a simple argument shows that the\\nσ(f1, . . ., fn) measurable functions coincide precisely with the functions that are almost\\neverywhere equal to F(f1, . . ., fn), where F is some measurable function on Sn.\\nThroughout these proofs we will use the following idea many times. Let (Ω, F, Pr) be\\na probability space, and let (S, S) be a measurable space. Suppose that X : Ω→S is a\\n3\\nmeasurable function such that σ(X) is the whole of F. If Y is any random variable on Ω\\ntaking values in R, then there exists a measurable map φ : S →R such that Y = φ ◦X\\nalmost surely. This is easily seen by approximating Y by simple functions.\\nTheorem 2.1. Let (fn) be a sequence of random variables taking values in a separable\\nmeasurable space (S, S).\\nThen there exists a sequence of measurable functions (gn :\\n[0, 1]n →S) that has the same law as (fn).\\nIf further we have that fn+1 is nowhere constant with respect to σ(f1, . . ., fn) for all\\nn ≥0, then we may suppose that σ(g1, . . ., gn) = Ln, for all n ≥1.\\nIf even further we have that (S, S) is R with the Borel sets, then we may suppose\\ngn is Borel measurable (that is, the preimages of Borel sets are Borel sets), and that\\ngn(x1, . . ., xn) is a strictly increasing function of xn ∈(0, 1) for almost all x1, . . ., xn−1.\\nProof:\\nWe may suppose without loss of generality that S = R, and S is the Borel subsets\\nof R. To see that we may do this, see ﬁrst that we may suppose without loss of generality\\nthat S separates points in S, that is, if s ̸= t ∈S, then there exists A ∈S such that s ∈A\\nand t /∈A. Let {Cn} be a countable collection of sets in S that generate S. Notice then\\nthat the sequence {Cn} also separates points in S, that is, if s ̸= t ∈S, then there exists a\\nnumber n such that one and only one of s or t is in Cn. Deﬁne a map ϕ : S →R:\\nϕ(s) =\\n∞\\nX\\nm=1\\nI(s∈Cm)\\n3m\\n.\\nClearly ϕ is injective. Further ϕ maps Cn to Dn ∩ϕ(S), where\\nDn =\\n( ∞\\nX\\nm=1\\nem\\n3m : em = 0 or 1, en = 0\\n)\\n,\\nand thus ϕ maps any element of S to a Borel subset of R intersected with ϕ(S). Conversely,\\nthe preimage of Dn under ϕ is Cn, and hence the preimage of any Borel set under ϕ is in\\nS. (This argument may be found in Chapter 1 of [DM]).\\nNow apply the theorem to (ϕ ◦fn), to obtain (gn). Since the law of gn is the same as\\nϕ ◦fn, the range of gn lies in the range of ϕ(S) with probability one. Then the sequence\\n(ϕ−1 ◦gn) will have the same law as (fn).\\nSo let us suppose as the induction hypothesis that we have obtained (gn : [0, 1]n →\\nR)1≤n≤N that has the same law as (fn)1≤n≤N, and that gn is Borel measurable, for all\\nn ≤N, where N is a non-negative integer. (The induction is started with N = 0 in which\\ncase the hypothesis is vacuously true. The arguments that follow simplify greatly in this\\ncase.)\\nFor each t ∈Q, let\\npt = E(I(fN+1<t)|σ(f1, . . ., fN)).\\nSince pt is σ(f1, . . . , fN) measurable, we may write\\npt = qt(f1, . . ., fN)\\nalmost surely\\n4\\nfor some Borel measurable function qt : RN →[0, 1]. Deﬁne the Borel measurable functions\\nrt by\\nrt = qt(g1, . . ., gN).\\nSince the sequence (rt)t∈Q has the same law as (pt)t∈Q, we see that there is a Borel\\nset B ⊂[0, 1]N of full measure such that if (x1, . . ., xN) ∈B, then rt(x1, . . ., xN) is an\\nincreasing function of t ∈Q, that tends to 0 as t →−∞, and tends to 1 as t →∞.\\nIf (x1, . . ., xN) ∈B and xN+1 ∈(0, 1), let\\ngN+1(x1, . . ., xN+1) = sup{t ∈Q : rt(x1, . . . , xN) < xN+1},\\nand let it be zero otherwise. We see that gN+1 is Borel measurable, since gN+1 on B×(0, 1)\\nis the supremum of countably many Borel measurable functions (st)t∈Q where\\nst(x1, . . ., xN+1) =\\n\\x1a\\nt\\nif rt(x1, . . ., xN) < xN+1\\n−∞\\notherwise.\\nIt is easy to see that gN+1 is always ﬁnite.\\nLet us now show that (f1, . . ., fN+1) has the same law as (g1, . . ., gN+1). It is suﬃcient\\nto show that for any Borel set A ⊂RN, and for t ∈Q, that\\nPr((f1, . . ., fN) ∈A and fN+1 < t) = λ((g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 < t).\\nSo let us begin.\\nλ((g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 < t)\\n= λ({(g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 < t} ∩B × (0, 1))\\n≤λ({(x1, . . ., xN+1) : (g1(x1), . . ., gN(x1, . . ., xN)) ∈A and rt(x1, . . ., xN) ≥xN+1}\\n∩B × (0, 1))\\n= λ({(x1, . . ., xN+1) : (g1(x1), . . ., gN(x1, . . ., xN)) ∈A and rt(x1, . . ., xN) ≥xN+1})\\n=\\nZ\\n[0,1]N\\nZ 1\\n0\\nI(rt≥x)I((g1,...,gN)∈A) dx dλ\\n=\\nZ\\n[0,1]N rtI((g1,...,gN)∈A) dλ\\n= E(ptI((f1,...,fN)∈A))\\n= E(I(fN+1<t)I((f1,...,fN)∈A))\\n= Pr((f1, . . ., fN) ∈A and fN+1 < t).\\nSimilarly\\nλ((g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 ≤t) ≥Pr((f1, . . ., fN) ∈A and fN+1 < t),\\n5\\nand so by Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem\\nλ((g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 < t) = lim\\nsրt\\ns∈Q\\nλ((g1, . . ., gN) ∈A and gN+1 ≤s)\\n≥lim\\nsրt\\ns∈Q\\nPr((f1, . . . , fN) ∈A and fN+1 < s)\\n= Pr((f1, . . ., fN) ∈A and fN+1 < t).\\nThus we have shown that (f1, . . ., fN+1) has the same law as (g1, . . ., gN+1).\\nNow let us add the assumption that fn+1 is nowhere constant with respect to σ(f1, . . ., fn)\\nfor all n ≥0. Let us assume the inductive hypothesis that σ(g1, . . . , gN) = LN,\\nThen there exist Borel measurable functions (αn : Rn →[0, 1])1≤n≤N such that for\\n1 ≤n ≤N we have\\nαn(g1(x1), . . ., gN(x1, . . ., xN)) = xn\\nalmost everywhere.\\nLet βn = αn(g1, . . ., gN), and let γn = αn(f1, . . ., fN).\\nNotice that gN+1(x1, . . ., xN+1) is an increasing function in xN+1 ∈(0, 1) for ﬁxed\\n(x1, . . ., xN) ∈B. Let us show that gN+1(x1, . . ., xN+1) is a strictly increasing function\\nin xN+1 ∈(0, 1) for (x1, . . ., xN) ∈C where C is a subset of B of full measure.\\nFor\\nsuppose otherwise. Then the following set has positive measure: the set of (x1, . . . , xN+1)\\nsuch that for some rational number t ∈[0, 1] we have that gN+1(x1, . . ., xN, xN+1) =\\ngN+1(x1, . . ., xN, t). But this is equal to the set\\n[\\nt∈[0,1]∪Q\\n{gN+1 = gN+1(β1, . . ., βN, t)}.\\nBut the measure of this set is the same as the probability of the set\\n[\\nt∈[0,1]∪Q\\n{fN+1 = gN+1(γ1, . . ., γN, t)}.\\nSince fN+1 is nowhere constant with respect to σ(f1, . . ., fN), it follows that this last set\\nhas probability zero.\\nLet us now show that σ(g1, . . ., gN+1) = LN+1. For any a ∈[0, 1] we have that\\n{gN+1 ≤gN+1(β1, . . ., βN, a)} = [0, 1]N × [0, a]\\nup to a set of measure zero.\\nThus σ(g1, . . ., gN+1) contains all set of the form [0, 1]N × [0, a]. Since it also contains\\nσ(g1, . . . , gN) = LN, the result follows.\\nQ.E.D.\\n6\\n3. Representation of martingales — 1\\nTheorem 3.1. Let (dn) be a Bochner integrable martingale diﬀerence sequence taking\\nvalues in a Banach space X. Then there exists a sequence of Bochner measurable functions\\n(en : [0, 1]n →X) such that (dn) has the same law as (en), and such that for almost every\\nx1, . . ., xn we have\\nZ 1\\n0\\nen(x1, . . ., xn) dxn = 0.\\nProof:\\nFirst we show that without loss of generality that we may assume that dn+1 is\\nnowhere constant with respect to σ(d1, . . . , dn) for all n ≥0. To do this, replace Ωby\\nΩ× [0, 1]N, replace X by X × R (where R is equipped with the sigma ﬁeld of Borel sets),\\nand replace dn by (ω, (xn)) 7→(dn(ω), xn −1\\n2). Apply the theorem to this sequence. After\\nobtaining the resulting (en), compose these functions with the natural projection of X ×R\\nto X.\\nFurther, since (dn) is Bochner integrable, we may suppose without loss of generality\\nthat X is separable.\\nApply Theorem 2.1 to obtain the sequence (en). Suppose that φ : [0, 1]n−1 →R is\\nany bounded measurable function. Then there exists a bounded Borel measurable function\\nθ : Xn−1 →R such that φ(x1, . . . , xn−1) = θ(e1(x1), . . ., en−1(x1, . . ., xn−1)) for almost\\nall x1, . . ., xn−1. Then\\nZ\\n[0,1]n φen dλ = E(θ(d1, . . ., dn−1)dn),\\nand this is zero because E(dn|σ(d1, . . ., dn−1)) = 0. The result follows.\\nQ.E.D.\\n7\\n4. Representation of tangent sequences\\nThe following deﬁnition may be found in [KW]. Let (Fn)n≥0 be an increasing sequence of\\nsigma ﬁelds on (Ω, F, Pr), where F0 is the trivial sigma ﬁeld. Two adapted sequences (fn)\\nand (gn) taking values in a measurable space (S, S) are said to be tangent if for each n ≥1\\nwe have that the law of fn conditionally on Fn−1 is the same as the law of gn conditionally\\non Fn−1, that is, E(I(fn∈A)|Fn−1) = E(I(gn∈A)|Fn−1) for any A ∈S.\\nNotice then that if F : S2n−1 →R is any measurable bounded function, that\\nE(F(f1, g1, . . ., fn−1, gn−1, fn)) = E(F(f1, g1, . . ., fn−1, gn−1, gn)).\\nThis is easily seen by reducing it to the case where F is a ﬁnite linear combination of\\ncharacteristic functions of sets of the form A1 × . . . × A2n−1 where A1, . . ., A2n−1 ∈S.\\nTheorem 4.1. Let (S, S) be a separable measurable space. Let (fn) and (gn) be S-valued\\nmeasurable sequences adapted to (Fn)n≥0 that are tangent. Then there exists a sequence\\n(hn : [0, 1]n →S), and a sequence of Borel measurable functions (φn : [0, 1]n →[0, 1]) such\\nthat the map φn(x1, . . . , xn−1, ·) is a measure preserving map on [0, 1] for almost every\\nx1, . . ., xn−1, such that the law of (fn, gn) is the same as the law of (hn, kn), where\\nkn(x1, . . ., xn) = hn(x1, . . ., xn−1, φn(x1, . . ., xn)).\\nFurther, if S is a separable Banach space, and (fn) is a martingale diﬀerence sequence\\nwith respect to Fn, then\\nZ 1\\n0\\nhn(x1, . . ., xn) dxn = 0\\nfor almost all x1, . . ., xn−1.\\nLemma 4.2. Let (S, S, µ), (T, T , ν) and (U, U, τ) be measure spaces such that U is sepa-\\nrable. Let φ : S × T →U be a measurable map such that for A ∈S and C ∈U we have\\nthat\\nµ ⊗ν((s, t) : s ∈A and φ(s, t) ∈C) = µ(A)τ(C).\\nThen φ(s, ·) is a measure preserving map T →U for µ almost every s.\\nProof:\\nThe hypothesis of the lemma can be recast as:\\nZ\\ns∈A\\nν(t : φ(s, t) ∈C) dµ(s) =\\nZ\\nA\\nτ(C) dµ,\\nfrom which we conclude that for every C ∈U, we have that ν(t : φ(s, t) ∈C) = τ(C) for\\nµ almost every s.\\nLet C be a countable subcollection of U that generates U. Then there exists a set\\nA ∈S of full measure such that ν(t : φ(s, t) ∈C) = τ(C) for C ∈C and s ∈A. Let\\nM = {C ∈U : ν(t : φ(s, t) ∈C) = τ(C) for s ∈A}.\\n8\\nNotice that M is a sigma ﬁeld that contains C, and hence M = U.\\nQ.E.D.\\nProof of Theorem 4.1:\\nWithout loss of generality (at least until we prove the last\\npart), let us suppose that S = R with the Borel sets. To do this, we use the same argument\\nthat we gave at the beginning of the proof of Theorem 2.1.\\nConsider the sequence (f1, g1, f2, g2, . . .). By the kind of argument we presented at the\\nbeginning of Theorem 3.1, we may suppose that each element of this sequence is nowhere\\nconstant with respect to the sigma ﬁeld generated by those elements in the sequence that\\nprecede it.\\nApplying Theorem 2.1, we create a sequence of Borel measurable functions (˜h1, ˜k1, ˜h2, ˜k2, . . .)\\nwith the same law, where ˜hn : [0, 1]2n−1 →R, ˜kn : [0, 1]2n →R, and ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, xn)\\nis a strictly increasing function of xn ∈(0, 1) for almost every x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1.\\nDeﬁne the function\\nrn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, s) = sup{t ∈Q ∩(0, 1) : ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, t) < s},\\nwhere we will set the ﬁrst supremum equal to zero if the set is empty. Notice that rn is the\\nsupremum of countably many Borel measurable functions, and hence is Borel measurable.\\nAlso, since ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., yn−1, xn−1, xn) is a strictly increasing function of xn ∈(0, 1) for\\nalmost every x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, we see that\\nrn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, xn)) = xn\\nfor almost every x1, y1, . . ., xn. Deﬁne\\n˜φn(x1, y1, . . ., xn, yn) = rn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, ˜kn(x1, y1, . . ., xn, yn)).\\nNow let αn, βn be functions such that\\nxn = αn(˜h1(x1), ˜k1(x1, y1), . . ., ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., xn))\\nalmost everywhere\\nyn = βn(˜h1(x1), ˜k1(x1, y1), . . ., ˜kn(x1, y1, . . . , xn, yn))\\nalmost everywhere,\\nand let γn, δn be random variables deﬁned by\\nγn = αn(f1, g1, . . ., fn)\\nδn = βn(f1, g1, . . ., fn, gn).\\nIf A is any Borel subset of [0, 1]2n−2, and C is a Borel subset of [0, 1], then since fn\\nand gn have the same law with respect to Fn−1,\\nλ((x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1) ∈A and ˜φn(x1, y1, . . ., xn, yn) ∈C)\\n= Pr((γ1, δ1, . . ., γn−1, δn−1) ∈A and rn(γ1, δ1, . . ., γn−1, δn−1, gn) ∈C)\\n= Pr((γ1, δ1, . . ., γn−1, δn−1) ∈A and rn(γ1, δ1, . . ., γn−1, δn−1, fn) ∈C)\\n= λ((x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1) ∈A and rn(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, ˜hn(x1, y1, . . ., xn)) ∈C)\\n= λ((x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1) ∈A and xn ∈C)\\n= λ(A)λ(C).\\n9\\nThus, by Lemma 4.2, we have that ˜φ(x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1, ·, ·) is a measure preserving\\nmap from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] for almost every x1, y1, . . ., xn−1, yn−1.\\nNow let x 7→(θ1(x), θ2(x)) be any Borel measurable measure preserving map from\\n[0, 1] to [0, 1]2. Let\\nhn(x1, . . ., xn) = ˜hn(θ1(x1), θ2(x1), . . ., θ1(xn))\\nkn(x1, . . ., xn) = ˜kn(θ1(x1), θ2(x1), . . ., θ1(xn), θ2(xn)).\\nNotice that\\nkn(x1, . . ., xn) = hn(x1, . . ., xn−1, φn(x1, . . ., xn)),\\nwhere\\nφn(x1, . . ., xn) = ˜φn(θ1(x1), θ2(x1), . . ., θ1(xn), θ2(xn)).\\nThe last part of the theorem follows by exactly the same argument as for Theorem 3.1.\\nQ.E.D.\\n5. Representation of sequences satisfying condition (C.I.)\\nThe following deﬁnition may be found in [KW]. Let (Fn)n≥0 be an increasing sequence of\\nsigma ﬁelds on (Ω, F, Pr), where F0 is the trivial sigma ﬁeld. An adapted sequence (fn)\\ntaking values in a measurable space (S, S) is said to satisfy condition (C.I.) if there exists\\na sigma ﬁeld G ⊂F such that the law of fn conditionally on Fn−1 is the same as the law\\nof fn conditionally on G, that is, E(I(fn∈A)|Fn−1) = E(I(fn∈A)|G) for any A ∈S, and if\\nthe sequence (fn) is conditionally independent with respect to G, that is, for any sequence\\nof sets An ∈S we have\\nE(I(f1∈A1) · · · I(fn∈An)|G) = E(I(f1∈A1)|G) · · ·E(I(fn∈An)|G).\\nIt is shown in [KW] that given any sequence (fn) adapted to some ﬁltration, that\\nafter possibly enlarging the underlying probability space, that there exists a sequence ( ˜fn)\\nthat is tangent to (fn) and that satisﬁes condition (C.I.).\\nIndeed, using Theorem 2.1, we can show a technically weaker but essentially identical\\nresult as follows.\\nLet (gn) be the sequence constructed by Theorem 2.1.\\nEnlarge the\\nprobability space [0, 1]N to [0, 1]N × [0, 1]N, and deﬁne the sequences\\nun((xn), (yn)) = gn(x1, . . . , xn−1, xn)\\nvn((xn), (yn)) = gn(x1, . . . , xn−1, yn).\\nThen (un) has the same law as (fn), and (vn) is tangent to (un) with respect to the ﬁltration\\n(Ln ⊗L0), and (vn) satisﬁes condition (C.I.). (Here Ln is the minimal complete sigma\\nﬁeld on [0, 1]N for which the ﬁrst n coordinate functions are measurable. In particular, L0\\ndenotes the trivial complete measure sigma ﬁeld on [0, 1]N.)\\nThis is the motivation behind the next result, which shows that this previous con-\\nstruction is the canonical representation.\\n10\\nTheorem 5.1. Let (S, S) be a separable measurable space.\\nLet (fn) be an S-valued\\nmeasurable sequence adapted to (Fn)n≥0 that satisﬁes condition (C.I.). Then there exists\\na sequence (hn : [0, 1]n →S) such that if we deﬁne the functions un on [0, 1]N × [0, 1]N by\\nun((xn), (yn)) = hn(x1, . . ., xn−1, yn),\\nthen the laws of (fn), (hn) and (un) are the same.\\nFurther, if S is a separable Banach space, and (fn) is a martingale diﬀerence sequence\\nwith respect to Fn, then\\nZ 1\\n0\\nhn(x1, . . ., xn) dxn = 0\\nfor almost all x1, . . ., xn.\\nProof:\\nAs usual, we suppose without loss of generality that fn is nowhere constant with\\nrespect to σ(f1, . . ., fn−1). Let (hn) be the sequence generated by Theorem 2.1. Then for\\nany A1, . . ., An ∈S we have that\\nPr((f1, . . ., fn) ∈A1 × · · · × An)\\n= E(E(I(f1∈A1) · · · I(fn∈An)|G))\\n= E(E(I(f1∈A1)|G) · · ·E(I(fn∈An)|G))\\n= E(E(I(f1∈A1)|F0) · · ·E(I(fn∈An)|Fn−1)).\\nNow for each k = 1, . . ., n, let Fk : Sk−1 →[0, 1] be the measurable function such that\\nE(I(fk∈Ak)|Fk−1) = Fk(f1, . . ., fk−1)\\nalmost surely.\\nNotice that if G : Sn−1 →R is bounded measurable, then\\nE(I(fk∈Ak)G(f1, . . ., fk−1)) = E(Fk(f1, . . ., fk−1)G(f1, . . ., fk−1)),\\nand hence\\nE(I(hk∈Ak)G(h1, . . . , hk−1)) = E(Fk(h1, . . ., hk−1)G(h1, . . ., hk−1)).\\nSince σ(h1, . . . , hk−1) = Lk−1, we see that\\nE(I(hk∈Ak)|Lk−1) = Fk(h1, . . ., hk−1)\\nalmost everywhere.\\nThus the sequence\\n(E(I(fk∈Ak)|Fk−1))1≤k≤n\\nhas the same law as the sequence\\n(E(I(hk∈Ak)|Lk−1))1≤k≤n,\\n11\\nand this last sequence is very easily seen to have the same law as the sequence\\n(E(I(uk∈Ak)|Lk−1 ⊗L0))1≤k≤n.\\nHence\\nE(E(I(f1∈A1)|F0) · · ·E(I(fn∈An)|Fn−1))\\n=\\nZ\\n(E(I(u1∈A1)|L0 ⊗L0) · · ·EI(un∈An)|Ln−1 ⊗L0) dλ ⊗λ,\\nand this last quantity is easily computed to be\\nλ ⊗λ((u1, . . ., un) ∈A1 × · · · × An).\\nFinally, the last part of the theorem follows exactly as in Theorem 3.1.\\nQ.E.D.\\n6. Tangent sequences in UMD spaces\\nThe concept of UMD spaces was introduced by Aldous [A], and extensively explored by\\nBurkholder [Bu]. It is from this second reference that the following deﬁnition of UMD\\n(along with many other equivalent deﬁnitions) may be found.\\nA Banach space X is said to be UMD if for some 1 < p < ∞(equivalently all\\n1 < p < ∞), there exists a positive constant c depending only upon X and p such that if\\n(dn) is a Bochner integrable X-valued martingale diﬀerence sequence, then for any signs\\nǫn = ±1, we have that\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nN\\nX\\nn=1\\nǫndn\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nLp(X)\\n≤c\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nN\\nX\\nn=1\\ndn\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nLp(X)\\n.\\nThis section is devoted to providing a new proof of the following result. This is essentially\\nthe same as the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.2 from the paper by McConnell [M2]. While the\\nfollowing proof can be rewritten so as to avoid needing the representation theorems, to do\\nso would be to remove the motivation behind this proof.\\nTheorem 6.1. Let X be a UMD space.\\nThen given 1 < p < ∞, there is a positive\\nconstant C, depending only upon X and p, such that given a ﬁltration (Fn)n≥0, and two\\nmartingales (fn) and (gn) adapted to this ﬁltration that are X-valued Bochner integrable\\nand tangent to each other, we have that\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nN\\nX\\nn=1\\ngn\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nLp(X)\\n≤C\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nN\\nX\\nn=1\\nfn\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nLp(X)\\n.\\nProof:\\nIt is suﬃcient to prove the inequality in the case when one of the sequences\\nsatisﬁes condition (C.I.), since the inequality may be then obtained by comparing both\\nsides with another sequence tangent to them both that satisﬁes condition (C.I.). We will\\n12\\nprove it in the case when the sequence (gn) satisﬁes condition (C.I.), but it will be evident\\nthat the proof also works when the sequence (fn) satisﬁes condition (C.I.).\\nSo applying Theorems 4.1 and 5.1, we see that there exists a sequence hn : [0, 1]n →X\\nof X-valued Bochner integrable functions such that\\nZ 1\\n0\\nhn(x1, . . ., xn) dxn = 0\\nfor almost all x1, . . ., xn−1, and such that if we deﬁne the the functions dn, en : [0, 1]N ×\\n[0, 1]N →X by\\ndn((xn), (yn)) = hn(x1, . . ., xn−1, xn)\\nen((xn), (yn)) = hn(x1, . . ., xn−1, yn),\\nthen the sequence (f1, g1, f2, g2, . . .) has the same law as the sequence (d1, e1, d2, e2, . . .).\\nNow we deﬁne a martingale diﬀerence sequence rn on [0, 1]N×[0, 1]N by r2n−1 = dn+en\\nand r2n = dn −en, where the ﬁltration is G2n = Ln ⊗Ln, and G2n−1 is the collection of\\nthose sets in G2n generated by sets like\\n{((xn), (yn)) : (x1, . . ., xn) ∈A × C, (y1, . . ., yn) ∈B × C},\\nwhere A, B ∈Ln−1, and C ∈L1.\\nThen we see that PN\\nn=1 dn = 1\\n2\\nP2N\\nn=1 rn and PN\\nn=1 en = 1\\n2\\nP2N\\nn=1(−1)n+1rn, and thus\\nthe result follows immediately from the fact that X is a UMD space.\\nQ.E.D.\\n13\\n7. Representations of martingales — 2\\nIn this section, we present a version of a result of McConnell [M1]. This result provides a\\nSkorohod like representation for vector valued martingales. Our result is weaker than that\\nof McConnell in that his process is adapted to a ﬁltration generated by a one-dimensional\\nBrownian motion. The process presented here is adapted to a two dimensional Brownian\\nmotion.\\nTheorem 7.1. Let (dn) be a Bochner integrable martingale diﬀerence sequence taking\\nvalues in a Banach space X. Then there exists a continuous time X-valued stochastic\\nprocess (Ft)t≥0 with continuous sample paths such that (dn) has the same law as (Fn −\\nFn−1). Furthermore, the process (Ft) is adapted to a two dimensional brownian motion.\\nProof:\\nLet D = {z ∈C : |z| < 1}, ¯D = {z ∈C : |z| ≤1} and ∂D = {z ∈C : |z| = 1},\\nand give ∂D normalized Lebesgue measure d|z|/2π. Since ∂D is measure equivalent to\\n[0, 1], we may apply Theorem 3.1 to obtain a sequence (en : ∂Dn →X) that has the same\\nlaw as (fn), and such that\\nZ\\n∂D\\nen(z1, . . ., zn) d|zn|\\n2π\\n= 0\\nfor almost every z1, . . ., zn−1.\\nFor each z1, . . ., zn−1, extend the function zn 7→en(z1, . . ., zn) to its harmonic exten-\\nsion on ¯D.

Miller, Rutgers University1\\nmiller@math.rutgers.edu\\nDecember 2001\\nAbstract\\nThese notes are from the Database of Automorphic L-functions\\nat http://www.math.rutgers.edu/∼sdmiller/l-functions . They\\nwere written up by Stephen Miller, and are based on discussions with\\nFreydoon Shahidi, Purdue University. They are meant to serve as an\\nintroduction to the Langlands-Shahidi method of studying L-functions\\nthrough the Fourier coeﬃcients of Eisenstein series.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nThe Langlands-Shahidi method uses information from spectral theory on\\nnon-compact spaces to obtain the functional equations and many analytic\\nproperties of L-functions, in particular several important examples of Lang-\\nlands L-functions. The reason for the connection to spectral theory is that\\nL-functions arise in the Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series. The sim-\\nplest example of this phenomenon occurs already on SL2(Z)\\\\H for the non-\\nholomorphic Eisenstein series\\nE(x + iy, s) =\\nX\\nm,n∈Z\\n(m,n)=1\\nys\\n|m(x + iy) + n|2s,\\nwhich has the Fourier expansion\\nE(x + iy, s) =\\nX\\nn∈Z\\nan(y, s)e2πinx,\\n(1.1)\\n1Supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0122799\\n1\\na0(y, s) = ys + ξ(2s −1)\\nξ(2s)\\ny1−s,\\nan(y, s) = 2|n|s−1/2σ1−2s(|n|)√yKs−1/2(2π|n|y)\\nξ(2s)\\n, n ̸= 0,\\nwhere ξ(s) = π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s) = ξ(1 −s) is the completed Riemann ζ func-\\ntion, σs(n) = P\\nd|n ds, and Ks(y) is the K-Bessel function. One can deduce\\nfrom the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1 −s) that\\nE(z, s) = ξ(2s −1)\\nξ(2s)\\nE(z, 1 −s).\\n(1.2)\\nThe main point of using spectral theory here is Maass’ Lemma, which\\nultimately implies that because E(z, s) and E(z, 1 −s) both have Laplace\\neigenvalue s(1−s), the two must be multiples of each other. The ratio can be\\nfound from the constant term a0(y, s), and so the functional equation (1.2)\\ncan be proven without knowing the functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1 −s).\\nMany results from functional analysis have been used to generalize the an-\\nalytic continuation and functional equation of Eisenstein series, starting with\\nSelberg and continued by Langlands [L1]. Their spectral methods in general\\ndo not assume any information about the L-functions (generalizing ζ(s)) that\\nare involved. In his Yale Monograph Euler Products ([L2]), Langlands ob-\\ntained the meromorphic continuation of a wide variety of L-functions using\\nthe theory of the constant term. His calculations led to the deﬁnition of the\\nL-group, and ultimately to the formulation of his functorality conjectures.\\nFurthermore, the functional equation (1.2) can be turned around to gain\\ninformation about the symmetries of the terms in the Fourier expansion\\n(1.1). In particular, an analysis of the ﬁrst Fourier coeﬃcient readily gives\\nthe functional equation ξ(s) = ξ(1 −s). This latter observation has been\\ndeveloped by Shahidi; in conjunction with Langlands’ constant term theory,\\nhe has applied an analysis to the non-constant terms of general Eisenstein\\nseries to obtain the functional equations and meromorphic continuation (with\\nonly a ﬁnite number of poles between 1/2 and 1) of the L-functions which\\noccur in the Fourier expansions of Eisenstein series.\\nIn general it has been a diﬃcult challenge to prove the L-functions are\\nentire.\\nKim has applied the following idea from representation theory to\\nrule out the poles on the real axis between 1/2 and 1 in many cases. These\\npotential poles are also singularities of Eisenstein series, and their residues are\\n2\\nL2-automorphic forms, which always correspond to unitary representations\\nthat can be explicitly described by the Eisenstein series they came from.\\nKim remarked that known results about the unitary dual show that many of\\nthese representations do not occur, allowing one to conclude the holomorphy\\nof the Eisenstein series and the L-functions at these points! When combined\\nwith [G-S], [Sh2], and [Sh3], this has recently led to new examples of entire\\nL-functions with breakthrough applications to the Langlands functorality\\nconjectures ([CKPSS],[K-S]).\\n2\\nAn Outline of the Method\\nThe following is a brief sketch of the main points of the method; a fuller\\nintroduction with more deﬁnitions and detailed examples can be found in\\n[Sh1]. Detailed examples of constant term calculations can be found in many\\nplaces, e.g. [L2],[L3],[G-S], and [M]. Though it is possible to describe the\\nmethod without adeles (as was done in the introduction), their use is key in\\nhigher rank for factoring inﬁnite product expansions into L-functions.\\nLet F be a ﬁeld, A = AF its ring of adeles, and G a split group over\\nF. Much carries over to quasi-split case as well, and we will highlight the\\ntechnical changes needed for this at the end.\\nFix a Borel (= a maximal\\nconnected solvable) subgroup B ⊂G, and a standard maximal parabolic\\nP ⊃B deﬁned over F.2 Decompose B = TU, where T is a maximal torus.\\nThe parabolic can be also decomposed as P = MN, where the unipotent\\nradical N ⊂U, and M is the unique Levi component containing T. Denote\\nby LG,L M,L N, etc. the Langlands dual L-groups (see [Sh1]).\\nOne of the key aspects of this method is that it uses many possibilities\\nof parabolics of diﬀerent groups, especially exceptional groups. This is si-\\nmultaneously a strength (in that there is a wide range of possibilities) and a\\nlimitation (in that there are only ﬁnitely many exceptional groups).\\n2.1\\nCuspidal Eisenstein Series\\nRecall that an automorphic form in L2(Γ\\\\G) is associated to a (unitary)\\nautomorphic representation of G mapping φ(h) 7→φ(hg). Let π = ⊗vπv be\\na cuspidal automorphic representation of M(A); we may assume that almost\\n2The theory can be extended to non-maximal parabolics, but this does not yield any\\nextra information about L-functions.\\n3\\nall components πv are spherical unitary representations (meaning that they\\nhave a vector ﬁxed by G(Ov), where Ov is the ring of integers of the local ﬁeld\\nFv). For these places v the equivalence class of the unitary representation πv\\nis determined by a semisimple conjugacy class tv ∈\\nLG, the L-group. This\\nconjugacy class is used to deﬁne the L-functions below in (2.3).\\nA maximal parabolic has a modulus character δP, which is the ratio of\\nthe Haar measures on M · N and N · M. It is related to the simple root of G\\nwhich does not identically vanish on P. For any automorphic form φ in the\\nrepresentation space of π, we can deﬁne the Eisenstein series\\nE(π, s, g) =\\nX\\nγ∈P (F )\\\\G(F )\\nφ(γg)δP(γg)s,\\n(2.1)\\nand their constant terms\\nc(π, s, g) =\\nZ\\nN′(F )\\\\N′(A)\\nE(φ, s, ng)dn,\\n(2.2)\\nwhere N′ is the opposite parabolic to N (it is related by the longest element\\nin the Weyl group).\\n2.2\\nLanglands L-functions\\nIf ρ is a ﬁnite-dimensional complex representation of LM and S is a ﬁnite set\\nincluding the archimedean and ramiﬁed places, then the partial Langlands\\nL-function is\\nLS(s, π, ρ) =\\nY\\nv/∈S\\ndet(I −ρ(tv)q−s\\nv )−1.\\n(2.3)\\nHere qv is the cardinality of the residue ﬁeld of Fv, a prime power. The full,\\ncompleted, L-function involves extra factors for places in S, whose deﬁnition\\nis technical and in general diﬃcult.\\n2.3\\nThe Constant Term Formula\\nThe constant term formula involves the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst, which\\nonly occurs when the parabolic is its own opposite, is essentially just φ(g).\\n4\\nLanglands showed that the map to the second term is given by an operator\\nM(s, π) =\\n m\\nY\\nj=1\\nL(ajs, ˜π, rj)\\nL(1 + ajs, ˜π, rj)\\n!\\n⊗v∈S A(s, πv),\\n(2.4)\\nwhere A(s, πv) are a ﬁnite collection of operators, r the adjoint action of\\nLM on the lie algebra of LN, r1, . . . , rm the irreducible representations it\\ndecomposes into, and aj integers which are multiples of each other (coming\\nfrom roots related to the rj). See [Sh1] for a fuller discussion along with an\\nexample for the Lie group G2 and the symmetric cube L-function. Tables\\nlisting Lie groups and the representations rj occurring for them can be found\\nin [L2] and [Sh3].\\n2.4\\nThe Non-Constant Term: Local Coeﬃcients\\nWe must now make a further restriction on the choice of π involved, namely\\nthat it be generic, i.e. have a Whittaker model. This means that if ψ is a\\ngeneric unitary character of U(F)\\\\U(A), we need to require\\nWv(g, ψ) =\\nZ\\nUM(F )\\\\UM (A)\\nφ(ng)ψ(n)dn ̸= 0,\\nUM = U ∩M\\nfor some φ and g.\\nShahidi’s formula uses the Casselman-Shalika formula for Whittaker func-\\ntions to express the non-constant term as\\nZ\\nN′(F )\\\\N′(A)\\nE(ng)ψ(n)dn =\\nY\\nv∈S\\nWv(1)\\nm\\nY\\nj=1\\n1\\nL(1 + ajs, ˜π, rj).\\n(2.5)\\nApplying the functional equation of the Eisenstein series (which has the\\nconstant-term ratio involved), one gets the “crude” functional equation for\\nthe product of m L-functions\\nm\\nY\\nj=1\\nLS(ajs, ˜π, rj) =\\nm\\nY\\nj=1\\nLS(1 −ajs, π, rj)\\nY\\nv∈S\\n(local factors) .\\n(2.6)\\n5\\nShahidi’s papers [Sh2] and [Sh3] match all the local factors above to the\\ndesired L-functions (as in the remark after (2.3)). This gives the full func-\\ntional equation for these m L-functions, but only when multiplied together.\\nHis 1990 paper [Sh3] uses an induction to isolate each of the m factors above\\nseparately.\\n2.5\\nAnalytic Properties and the Quasi-Split Case\\nIt remains to prove that the L-functions are entire, except perhaps at s = 0\\nand 1 where the order of the poles is understood. The theory of Eisenstein\\nseries provides this full analyticity except for when π satisﬁes a self-duality\\ncondition; even in this case, it can be shown that the L-functions have only\\na ﬁnite number of poles, all lying on the real axis between 1\\n2 and 1. Kim’s\\nobservation of using the unitary dual has worked in many cases. It is also\\nalways possible to remove the potential poles by twisting by a highly-ramiﬁed\\nGL(1) character of AF; this has been crucial for applications to functorality\\nby the converse theorem [CPS].\\nThe main diﬀerence in the quasi-split case is that the action of the Galois\\ngroup GF is no longer trivial. The L-groups are potentially disconnected as\\na semi-direct product of a connected component and GF. Also, the repre-\\nsentation ρ used to deﬁne the Langlands L-functions may also depend on the\\nplace v.\\nReferences\\n[CKPSS] J. W. Cogdell, H.H. Kim, I.I.

      "**LoRA tuning (Low‑Rank Adaptation)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "LoRA is a *parameter‑efficient* fine‑tuning technique for very large transformer models.  \n",
      "Instead of updating every weight of the pretrained network, LoRA **freezes the original\n",
      "parameters** and injects a pair of small, trainable matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) (the “adapter”) into the linear\n",
      "layers that dominate the model (typically the attention projections and/or the MLP\n",
      "feed‑forward blocks).\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "W  →  W + ΔW ,   ΔW = α·B·A      (rank r << original dimension)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Low‑rank** – \\(A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times r}\\) and \\(B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times d}\\) with a rank \\(r\\) that is orders of magnitude\n",
      "smaller than the full weight matrix dimension \\(d\\). In the internal experiments the rank was set\n",
      "to 8 and a dropout of 0.05 was used.  \n",
      "* **Adapter‑based** – Only the two small matrices are learned; the massive pretrained\n",
      "weights stay unchanged.  \n",
      "* **PEFT‑compatible** – LoRA is implemented in the PEFT (Parameter‑Efficient\n",
      "Fine‑Tuning) library, so it can be added to any Hugging‑Face model with a single\n",
      "API call.\n",

      "|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n",
      "| **Model parameters** (FP16/FP32)  | All ≈ hundreds of millions‑to‑billions | Only the frozen base (no gradients) + tiny adapters |\n",
      "| **Optimizer states** (momentum, Adam‑type) | One copy per full parameter | One copy per adapter parameter (≈ 0.1 % of total) |\n",
      "| **Activation gradients** (back‑prop) | Needed for every weight update | Needed only for the adapter pathways; the frozen backbone’s activations can be recomputed or kept in lower‑precision buffers |\n",

      "\n",
      "The memory savings come from three concrete effects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **No gradient storage for the frozen backbone** – the optimizer does not need to keep\n",
      "   momentum or variance buffers for billions of parameters; only the tiny adapter\n",
      "   matrices require them.\n",
      "2. **Smaller activation‑gradient graph** – because the adapters are low‑rank, the\n",
      "   backward pass touches far fewer tensors, shrinking the intermediate activation\n",
      "   buffers that dominate GPU RAM during training.\n",
      "3. **Merge‑after‑training** – once fine‑tuning finishes, the low‑rank product \\(B·A\\) can be\n",
      "   folded into the original weight matrix, so inference incurs **zero extra\n",
      "   parameters or compute**, keeping the runtime memory identical to the base model.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the internal retrieval‑augmented chatbot project the LoRA configuration\n",
      "(rank = 8, dropout = 0.05) reduced the GPU memory footprint by **about 60 %**, allowing\n",
      "the same hardware (e.g., an A100) to fine‑tune models that would otherwise be too\n",
